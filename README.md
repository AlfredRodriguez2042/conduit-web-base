# Norelian Conduit Web Base

This is a base project, based on the excelent [realworld.io](https://realworld.io).

## Getting Starteed

Your mission, shall you decide to accept it, is to create your own implementation of this project using your framework of choice.


## Getting started

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server 

Local web server will use port 8080

### Making requests to the backend API

For convenience, there is a live API server running at https://conduit.productionready.io/api, thanks to the react implementation of this demo for the application to make requests against. You can view [the API spec here](https://github.com/GoThinkster/productionready/blob/master/api) which contains all routes & responses for the server.

## Delivery

Just create a PR to this repository with your username, we'll take it from there.

*HAPPY CODING*
